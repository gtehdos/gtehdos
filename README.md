We're trying to develop GTEH DOS 5.0, GTEH Studio's others team was dismissed.

Include GTEH Studio Software Team, GTEH Studio Hardware Team, GTEH Studio GUI Team, GTEH Studio Cloud Team, GTEH Studio Wiki Team,GTEH Studio Support Team and others. Salute the above and others.

Now all team was dismissed, GTEH Studio changed to GTEH DOS Team.

All service was stopped. We only develop DOS 5.0.

Thank you. Maybe DOS 5.0 will stopped, too.
